# S - Single responsibility

According to this principle, a class should have only one reason to change, that is, it should have only one task or responsibility.

## Imagine

To illustrate this principle, letâ€™s think of an orchestra.
Each musician has an instrument they know how to play perfectly.
The violinist knows how to play the violin, but if we also put them to play the drum, surely something would not work well.

## Advantages

- **Clean**: clean and standard code
- **Maintainable**: Manageable and easy for maintenance
- **Scalable and readable**: Easy to refactor or change and readable code

## Disadvantages

- To many small modules/classes
- Take more time for development and increases project cost
